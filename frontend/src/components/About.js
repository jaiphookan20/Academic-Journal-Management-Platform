        Studies in Language Assessment (SiLA) is a peer-reviewed international journal in the field of language testing and assessment. 
        It is published on an open access basis by the sponsoring organisation, the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of 
        Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ). The Committee of ALTAANZ has general oversight of the journal in terms of publication policy 
        and financial matters. However, all editorial decisions are in the hands of two co-editors, who are elected by the membership of 
        ALTAANZ for concurrent two-year terms. The co-editors periodically seek advice on policy matters from an editorial board comprising 
        leading members of ALTAANZ in Australia and New Zealand as well as top researchers in the field elsewhere in the world. 
        Membership of the board is reviewed annually and new members are added by invitation of the co-editors.
